    <div class="img"><img class="center" src="./hobbit/bilbo.jpeg" alt="bilbo baggins"><br><br>
       <p>Bilbo is a hobbit from the Shire, a small, out-of-the-way place in Middle-Earth. He is in his prime of life at the age of 50. He is small in height, with large hairy feet and curly hair. As a hobbit he appreciates a good pint, his pipe, and the comforts of home; travel and adventure were not things he took part in.</p>

    <p>"Tauriel is the head of the Elven Guard," Lilly explains. "She's a Sylvan Elf, which means she's of a much lower order than the elves we all became acquainted with in The Lord of the Rings.

Gollum is a sad, lonely, miserable creature who lives by a very cold and dark lake. He is slimy and pale with large eyes that turn green when he is angry. He spends his days rowing his boat with his feet hanging over the edge, catching blind fish, or wearing his magical ring that makes him invisible and allows him to sneak up on and murder goblins</p></div>
